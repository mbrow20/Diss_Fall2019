<p>These are the functions and the .csv data and datasets used for the simulation of the dissertation. <strong> Be sure to download all these files into a single directory (folder) on your computer.</strong> Below is a description of the different functions. Many of the functions are run through "ExampleCodeSim15Vars2LevNormWt.R". To utilize the various functions within this R script, specify using the source(), as in <strong>source("Functions13Sub.R")</strong>. In the last line of the 'ExampleCodeSim15Vars2Lev'-class of launch applications you can specify the number of iterations to run for the simulation. Here is an example,</p>
<p> <strong>SimulationWithCovMat(CovMatrixWt,data1,10,mu_beta)</strong>,</p> 

<p>where the number of simulations to run is ten. Here is an example where the launch' application "ExampleCodeSim15Vars2LevlNormWt.R' calls the function <strong><i>Functions6SR.R</i></strong> (a functions that performs data trimming) with 500 iterations:</p>

<p>(Also, within the functions themselves, it is possible to run a truncated version of the dataset (for speed of computation; not recommended for analysis) that creates a random sample of the data proportional to treatment status. If <strong>.2</strong> is chosen, for example, it will randomly select 20% of the data, maintaining the ratio of treated and control observations. Within the functions themselves, you can comment out (# before a command line) code lines. Here is code for the full data set:</p>
<blockquote>
S2<<-as.matrix(CovMatrixWt,nrow=nrow(CovMatrixWt),ncol=ncol(CovMatrixWt))<br>
set.seed(6)#ensures same results for random components (e.g., partitioning data, random variable selection, etc.)<br>
colnames(data1)[1]<<-"SC048Q01"<br>
<strong>#</strong>dpart<<-createDataPartition(data1$treat, p=0.2, list=F)<br>
<strong>#</strong>data2<<-data1 [dpart,]<br>
data2<<-data1<br>
   </blockquote>
or for the partial data set (in this case, 20 percent):<br>
<blockquote>
dpart<<-createDataPartition(data1$treat, <strong>p=0.2</strong>, list=F)<br>
data2<<-data1 [dpart,]<br>
#data2<<-data1<br>
</blockquote>
<p>Search the function themselves to find these lines. With some functions, e.g.,<strong><i> Functions13Sub.R</strong></i>, <strong><i>Functions18.R</strong></i>, and<strong><i> Functions5VAR500.R</strong></i>, it is <strong>not possible to use the partition option as these functions require the full number of observations</strong>. Here is a brief explanation of the functions. A full explanation can be found in the <i>Appendix</i> of the dissertation. Most functions estimate RMSE, provide a table of balance statistics, and output a t-stat(df) for sensitivity analysis (null being no confounding due to unobserved covariates).</p>
